This is an archive of minetest_game before all mod licenses were changed to 
be more restrictive in the name of offended sensibilities and (more reasonably)
additional legal protection.

All LGPL code has been removed, as this will not be affected in this license change,
only WTFPL code.
All assets have been left, as these are under a seperate license to the code.

Minetest Game [minetest_game]
=============================
The main subgame for the Minetest engine
========================================

To use this subgame with the Minetest engine, insert this repository as
	/games/minetest_game

The Minetest engine can be found in:
	https://github.com/minetest/minetest/

Compatibility
--------------
The Minetest Game github master HEAD is generally compatible with the github
master HEAD of the Minetest engine.

Additionally, when the Minetest engine is tagged to be a certain version (eg.
0.4.10), Minetest Game is tagged with the version too.

When stable releases are made, Minetest Game is packaged and made available in
	http://minetest.net/download
and in case the repository has grown too much, it may be reset. In that sense,
this is not a "real" git repository. (Package maintainers please note!)
